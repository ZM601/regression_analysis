    "### Application: Natural Experiment. Consider the empirical model about house pricing and incinerator. In 1980, there was the news that a garbage incinerator would be built somewhere in Springﬁeld; In 1981, the construction actually began. We want to know the eﬀect of the garbage on house prices. Use the data in KIELMC for this exercise. See KIELMC description.txt for variable descriptions."

This was supported by the estimates in (2) based on the data from 1978, in which year there was no news about the new incinerator. The estimates in (2) suggested that, without any eﬀect of the future incinerator, the location itself was not desirable so that the houses nearby the location of future incinerator had been sold for 33.99% less on average than the houses not nearby (the location of future incinerator)."
